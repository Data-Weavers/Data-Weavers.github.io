# Extension of the ReadBackPhased haplotypes using phASE-Extender.

I will try to provide an exposure on the algorithm used by phase-Extender under the hood for the preparation of long range haplotypes (and possibly genome wide haplotype). phase-Extender uses short blocks of ReadBackPhased haplotypes in a population of samples and applies LD test between two consecutive blocks in one sample at a time . I am not delving into additional details of haplotype phasing and RBphasing â€“ I am sure there are other excellent sources to gather information on this matter
